# IDATA2304 IoT project

## Antiboom
Antiboom is our solution to the Autumn 2022 IDATA2304 Computer Networks project which involves building a prototype of a meaningful IoT application. The application is a Raspberry Pi health monitor which periodically logs processor temperature(s) and displays them in a user-friendly fashion on a web interface. The main idea stems from the potential problem that arises when IoT devices are placed in hot environments, such as inside fuel price signs at gas stations, where the temperatures may exceed what's considered safe for the device. Antiboom helps prevent any potential device damage by providing a real-time graph of minimum, average and maximum temperatures within a set time period, which also helps discover any flaws with the device, such as broken fans or heat sinks.

## Architecture
The project requires a minimum of two nodes programmed by the students, which is achieved and further abstracted into a total of four components in control:
- Sensor nodes
- Ingestion service
- SQL database
- Visualization service
