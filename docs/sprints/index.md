# Project sprints

The project is being run in 1 week long sprints.
For creating, distributing and tracking issues we use GitHub Projects. 
The project can be found [here](https://github.com/users/thedatasnok/projects/2).

Each issue is labeled by the sprint they were completed in. (e.g. Sprint 1)

A list of each sprint runs report: 

- [Sprint 1: Project start][sprint-1] (Oct 18 - Oct 24)
- [Sprint 2][sprint-2] (Oct 25 - Oct 31)
- [Sprint 3][sprint-3] (Nov 1 - Nov 7)
- [Sprint 4][sprint-4] (Nov 8 - Nov 14)
- [Sprint 5][sprint-5] (Nov 15 - Nov 21)
- [Sprint 6][sprint-6] (Nov 22 - Nov 28)
- [Sprint 7: Project finale][sprint-7] (Nov 29 - Dec 5)
